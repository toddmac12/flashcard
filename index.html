    <h3 id="header1">Javascript (JS)</h3>
    <div id="p1">
        <p>JavaScript is a programming language used to make web pages interactive.</p>
    </div>
    <h3 id="header2">Operators</h3>
    <div id="p2">
        <p>+, -, *, /, and % are called operators. An operator is a special character (or characters) that indicates an action to be performed.</p>
    </div>
    <h3 id="header3">Variables</h3>
    <div id=p3>
        <p>A variable is just a container that stores some information such as a number, an object, or a string.</p>
    </div>
    <h3 id="header4">Variable naming conventions</h3>
    <div id=p4>
        <p>Use lowerCamelCase when naming JavaScript variables. Start with a lowercase letter, and if the variable name is more than one word, remove all spaces and capitalize the first letter of each subsequent word. Variables should begin with a letter,
            are case sensitive and should have clear names.</p>
    </div>
    <h3 id="header5">Functions</h3>
    <div id="p5">
        <p>Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take
            some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.</p>
    </div>
    <h3 id="header6">Methods</h3>
    <div id="p6">
        <p>A method is an action run on a piece of data; you can think of it as a message you send to a piece of data, and the result is the response.</p>
    </div>
    <h3 id="header7">Arguments</h3>
    <div id="p7">
        <p>Some methods take one or more arguments that provide the method with additional information to help it perform its action.</p>
    </div>
    <h3 id="header8">Parameters</h3>
    <div id="p8">
        <p>A parameter is a variable that's assigned to an argument.</p>
    </div>
    <h3 id="header9">Return</h3>
    <div id="p9">
        <p>The return value is the method's response.</p>
    </div>
    <h3 id="header10">Chaining Methods</h3>
    <div id="p10">
        <p>Calling a method directly on the return value of another method.</p>
    </div>
    <h3 id="header11">Strings</h3>
    <div id="p11">
        <p>A string is a set of characters enclosed in quotations. "hello " is a string. So is "Good morning, everyone!!! " And, just to make things a little tricky, "21 " is a string, not a number. That's because it's enclosed in quotations, and any set
            of characters - whether that's letters, numbers, nineteen exclamation points in a row, or some combination thereof - is a string.</p>
    </div>
    <h3 id="header12">Booleans</h3>
    <div id="p12">
        <p>A boolean can be one of two values: true or false. That's it.</p>
    </div>
    <h3 id="header13">Undefined</h3>
    <div id="p13">
        <p>This means something hasn't been defined in our code yet.</p>
    </div>
    <h3 id="header14">NaN</h3>
    <div id="p14">
        <p>Not a number.</p>
    </div>
    <h3 id="header15">Null</h3>
    <div id="p15">
        <p>Null just means nothing. We will sometimes want to assign a null value to a thing because we don't know what value it should have yet.</p>
    </div>
    <h3 id="header16">Attributes</h3>
    <div id="p16">
        <p>These include classes and IDs, which describe what code may apply to an element.</p>
    </div>
    <h3 id="header17">Comments</h3>
    <div id="p17">
        <p>anything following // on a line in JavaScript is ignored by the computer. Comments are a convenient way to leave notes in your code for yourself or other programmers.</p>
    </div>
    <h3 id="header18">Alert</h3>
    <div id="p18">
        <p>The alert() method displays an alert box with a specified message and an OK button.</p>
    </div>
    <h3 id="header19">jQuery</h3>
    <div id="p19">
        <p>jQuery is a JavaScript library that makes it easier to incorporate JavaScript on your web pages.</p>
    </div>
